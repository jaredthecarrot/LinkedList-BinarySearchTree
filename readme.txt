Completed all functions as stated.
Erase function does not have a case for if the user enters a number that is not in the list. This will cause the program to exit/crash.
(I am unsure if it is technically a crash or just a normal exit, but it is not a quick exit.)
Therefore, intention is for user to know that the number is not in the list, and not call for an erase of that number.
This should be acceptable given that the user has access to multiple traversals of the list, so they should be aware of numbers that are in the list.
I would normally include a warning at the start of the program, but I did not want to clutter the actual intention of the program,
which was to simply create a binary search tree of random integers.
The testing code is commented out, so you can uncomment to see my testing of the program.
